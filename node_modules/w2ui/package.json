  "readme": "## W2UI 1.4 - MIT License\n\nW2UI is modern, intuitive JavaScript UI library for building rich data-driven web application. The library has\na small footprint and no dependencies except jQuery. The library has the following widgets:\n\n* w2layout\n* w2grid\n* w2toolbar\n* w2sidebar\n* w2tabs\n* w2form\n* w2fields\n* w2popup\n* w2utils\n\nThe complete library is only **69Kb** (minified & gzipped)\n\n\n## Who Uses It\n\nIf you're using w2ui I'd love to hear about it and will be compiling a list of projects that use it. Please email me at vitmalina@gmail.com and\nif you can included name of you company (or project) and a link (if it is on a public website), that would be fantastic.\n\n## Quick Start\n\nCurrent stable version is 1.4. \n\nYou can:\n- Download from here: [http://w2ui.com](http://w2ui.com) \n- Install using bower\n\n```\nbower install w2ui\n```\n\nTo start using the library you need to include into your page: \n\n- w2ui-1.4.js (or w2ui-1.4.min.js) \n- w2ui-1.4.css (or w2ui-1.4.min.css) \n\nAll the widgets and their css classes are defined inside of these two files. There is no image dependencies, some images\nare embedded into CSS file.\n\nThere is no requirement for a server side language. Node, Java, PHP, ASP, Perl or .NET all will work, as long as you can \nreturn JSON format from the server (or write a converter into JSON format on the client).\n\n[Getting Started Guide](http://w2ui.com/web/get-started)\n\n\n## Documentation & Demos\n\nYou can find documentation and demos here:\n\n* [http://w2ui.com/web/docs](http://w2ui.com/web/docs) - documentation\n* [http://w2ui.com/web/demos](http://w2ui.com/web/demos) - demos\n\n\n## Bug Tracking\n\nHave a bug or a feature request? Please open an issue here [https://github.com/vitmalina/w2ui/issues](https://github.com/vitmalina/w2ui/issues). \nPlease make sure that the same issue was not previously submitted by someone else.\n\n\n## Building\n\nI have switched to Grunt as a build tool. You will find Gruntfile.js in the root. You still can build with ANT if you are more comformatble with it. \nBoth processes will produces same w2ui.js and w2ui.css files. Grunt has a few more tasks, such as watch, to auto compiles less and js files as you \ndevelop. Both tools will do the following:\n\n- Compile LESS files\n- Concatenate and minify CSS files\n- Concatenate, uglify and minify JS files \n\nTo use ANT, you will need to install NodeJS and NPM, then run the following command to install dependencies\n\n```\nsudo npm install less -g\nsudo npm install clean-css -g\nsudo npm install uglify-js@1 -g\n```\n\nTo use Grunt, you will still need to install NodeJS and NPM, then run npm install that will install all dependencies as\nthey are described in package.json file.\n\n```\nsudo npm install\n```\n\n## File Structure\n\n```\n- dist           - compiled JS and CSS files \n- src            - source JS files\n  - kickstart    - copy of another project used with the demos (not part of w2ui itself)\n  - less         - LESS files (source for css)\n- demos          - all demos, same as on the website\n- libs           - auxilary libraries (jquery, codemirror, etc.) used in the demos (not part of w2ui itself)\n- server         - example implementations for a server implementation communicating with w2ui instances\n- test           - feature testing files\n  - qunit        - some qunit test\n```\n\n\n## Contributing\n\nYour contributions are welcome. However, few things you need to know before contribution:\n\n1. Please check out latest code before changing anything. It is harder to merge if your changes will not merge clean.\n2. If you are changing JS files - do all changes in /src folder\n3. If you are changing CSS files - do all changes in LESS in /src/less/src\n4. If you want to help with unit test - do all changes in /test/qunit\n5. If you want to change documenation - do all changes in /docs\n6. If you want to add demos - do all changes in /demos\n\n",
